# dk105_cc

This repository contains all code written live during the DIKULT105 Web Developer Crash Course.

The code in the file has not been modified since the course, but I've added a lot of comments explaining parts of the code for those that might be a bit unsure on what certain things do.

For a overview of all core elements in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, visit https://learn.dombesteindata.net/ or https://w3schools.com/.

The presentation slides and the full recording of the course can *soon (tm)* be found in the DIKULT105 class module on Mitt UiB.
