        Elemenents are selected using different selector types;
        - Class selector (e.g. .box) - Selects all elements of a given class
        - ID Selector (e.g. #bold) - Selects an item with the given ID
        - Element Selector (e.g. p) - Selects all items of the given element.

        border adds a border around the given element
        color changes the color of the given element
        font-weight changes the weight of the text. The available weights depend on the font-family being used.z

        The class attribute in the div here identifies this div as a box. This class identifier can be used in JavaScript to modify or read its contents,
        or in css to style a given set of elements with a given class/id

        <h4>Learn More</h4>
        <!-- 
            Links (<a>) can be placed both as separate elements and within text (<p>) elements.

            A link needs a href (Hypertext Reference) to tell the browser where to go when clicked.

            The target attribute (target="") can take the following parameters:
            - _self - The default value here. Opens the link in the same tab you're currently in.
            - _blank - Opens the link in a new tab
            - _parent - Opens the link in the parent frame 
            - _top - Opens the link in the full body of the window

            _parent and _top are only required in a situation where you have a website within a website (also known as iFrame).

            rel="Noopener noreferrer" tells the browser to not provide the referrer page to the page being opened
        -->
        <p class="text">To learn more, visit <a href="https://learn.dombesteindata.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> </p>
    </div>

    <!--
        The ID attribute here functions just like the class attribute, but ID is more specific and should only be used on one element per ID. 

        Tip: In styling a page, specificity will automatically apply the specific style for an ID if an element has the same style 
        being applied by both a class selector and id selector.
    -->
    <p class="text" id="bold">This should be separate from the content above.</p>
    
    <!--
        You can add videos to your page,
        these can, just as images, be imported from a local file (as below), or from a website.
        Remember to add "controls" to the video element to be able to play the video

        type="video/mp4" defines what video type this is, remember to change this to the correct format of your video (mp4/ogg/gif/etc)
