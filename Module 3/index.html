                An input field is any field you want to enter data into.
                - The type attribute specifies what type this input field is. You can choose between text, password (will censor the input) or number.
                - The name attribute is mainly used as an identifier server-side to process the data.
                - The placeholder attribute displays the provided text when there is nothing entered in the input field. 
                - The required attribute tells the browser to not allow the form to be submitted before anything has been entered into the field

                A textarea is similar to a input field, the key difference is that it doesn't have a specified type,
                but instead takes a row attribute which defines the default size for the area. 

                The textarea can be resized on the user's side by clicking and dragging the resize-handle in the bottom-right
                of the area while on the website. Once the page is refreshed, the area will go back to it's default size.

        <!-- 
            A button with the type submit will by default refresh the page when clicked, if hooked up to a function in JavaScript,
            that code will also be executed. We can also disable this refresh behavior in JavaScript.

    <!--
        Script tags let us write JavaScript in a HTML file, or load an external JavaScript file using src="pathToJSFile.js" within the first script tag.

        A Script tag should always be placed at the bottom of the page to ensure that the script doesn't load before the page content is ready.
        The reason for this is that in most cases, We will try to fetch and modify HTML-elements in JS,
        and if those elements aren't ready when the script runs, the page will just load with those elements unmodified.

        We can also use a event listener called DOMContentLoaded which explicitly waits until the DOM (Document Object Model, fancy word for the HTML)
        is fully loaded before we try to get the elements and update them. This event listener should usually be at the top level of the page
        if it's needed.

            To get the page elements, we can use either their class- or id-name. 
            document.getElementById fetches a specific element based on it's ID.
            We can also fetch a full class by using document.getElementsByClassName.
            The provided ID or Class Name must match the id or class name given in the HTML document.

            addEventListener adds an event listener to the provided element. Event listeners can be a lot of different things, but 'click' is the 
            most used one. When the provided element is clicked, we perform the function as defined within the function block.

            In this case we allso pas inn the click event, which describes essentially what just happened. What button was clicked, what clicked it,
            the position etc etc.

            After defining what type of event we're listening for, and passing any eventual parameters 
            (the parenteses here can also be left blank like such "()")
            we define a function block which tells the browser what actions to perform when this button is clicked.
